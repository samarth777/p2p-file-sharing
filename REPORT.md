## Problem Statement:

Traditional client-server file sharing relies on a central server, creating a single point of failure and potential bottlenecks. If the central server goes down, the entire sharing capability is lost. Furthermore, scaling such systems can be expensive. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks offer a decentralized alternative where individual computers (peers) connect directly to share resources.

This project aims to develop a simple command-line P2P file sharing application in Java. The application allows users to designate a directory on their computer for sharing files, connect to other peers on the network, browse the files shared by connected peers, and download desired files directly from them. The system should handle multiple connections simultaneously and persist information about known peers and download history for better usability across sessions.

## Key Features:

*   **Peer Initialization:** Start the application as a peer, specifying a port for listening and a directory for sharing files.
*   **Peer Discovery & Connection:** Manually connect to other peers by providing their IP address and port number.
*   **File Listing (Remote):** View the list of files shared by currently connected peers.
*   **File Listing (Local):** View the list of files available in the local shared directory.
*   **File Download:** Download a specific file from a connected peer. Includes progress indication.
*   **Persistence:** Store information about successfully connected peers (IP/Port) in a local SQLite database (`p2p_data.db`) to facilitate future connections.
*   **Download History:** Record details of completed and failed downloads (file name, peer, size, status, timestamp) in the SQLite database.
*   **Concurrency:** Handle multiple incoming peer connections simultaneously using Java Threads (`PeerHandler`).
*   **Command-Line Interface:** Interact with the application through a simple text-based menu.

### Class Diagram:

*   **Key Classes:**
    *   `P2PFileSharing` (Main entry point)
    *   `PeerController` (Singleton, manages flow, holds commands)
    *   `Peer` (Core logic, server socket, manages connections, file operations, Facade)
    *   `ConsoleView` (Handles all console I/O)
    *   `Command` (Interface)
    *   `ConnectCommand`, `ListRemoteFilesCommand`, `DownloadFileCommand`, `ListLocalFilesCommand`, `ListKnownPeersCommand`, `ViewDownloadHistoryCommand`, `ExitCommand` (Concrete command implementations)
    *   `PeerConnection` (Represents an outgoing connection state and communication)
    *   `PeerHandler` (Runnable, handles incoming requests from one peer)
    *   `PersistenceService` (Handles SQLite database interactions)
    *   `DownloadRecord` (Data class for history)
*   **Relationships:**
    *   `PeerController` uses `Peer`, `ConsoleView`, `PersistenceService`, and `Command` map.
    *   `Peer` uses `ConsoleView`, `PersistenceService`, `PeerConnection`, `ServerSocket`, `Socket`. Creates `PeerHandler`.
    *   Concrete Commands use `Peer`, `ConsoleView`, `PersistenceService` as needed. Implement `Command`.
    *   `PeerHandler` uses `Socket`, `Peer`, `ConsoleView`. Implements `Runnable`.
    *   `PeerConnection` uses `Socket`.
    *   `PersistenceService` uses JDBC (`Connection`, `Statement`, `ResultSet`, etc.).
*   **Key Attributes/Methods:** Show important fields (port, sharedDirectory, connectedPeers, commands, db connection details) and methods (`start`, `startServer`, `connectToPeer`, `downloadFile`, `execute`, `run`, `savePeer`, `recordDownload`, etc.).

## Architecture Patterns, Design Principles, and Design Patterns:

### Architecture Patterns

*   **Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Controller (MVC) Pattern (Conceptual):** The application structure loosely follows MVC principles to separate concerns:
    *   **Model:** Represents the application's data and business logic. This includes classes like `Peer` (core P2P logic, connections, file operations), `PeerConnection` (state of a connection), `PersistenceService` (data access logic), and `DownloadRecord` (data structure).
    *   **View:** Responsible for the presentation layer and user interaction. In this application, `ConsoleView` handles all input/output to the command line.
    *   **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. `PeerController` takes user input (menu choices) from the `ConsoleView`, interprets it, and invokes actions on the Model (often via Command objects).
    *   *Note:* This is a conceptual implementation, not using a specific MVC framework like Spring MVC.

### Design Principles

*   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class aims to have a single, well-defined responsibility.
    *   `ConsoleView`: Solely responsible for console input and output.
    *   `PersistenceService`: Solely responsible for database interactions (SQLite).
    *   `PeerHandler`: Responsible for handling all communication logic for a single incoming peer connection.
    *   `PeerController`: Responsible for the main application loop and command dispatching.
    *   `Peer`: Encapsulates the core P2P logic (server, outgoing connections, file transfers).
    *   `PeerConnection`: Manages the state and communication streams for one outgoing connection.
*   **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** The application is open for extension but closed for modification. This is primarily achieved through the Command pattern. New functionalities (commands) can be added by creating new `Command` implementations and adding them to the `PeerController`'s command map without modifying the `PeerController`'s main loop or existing commands.
*   **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
    *   `PeerController` depends on the `Command` interface, `ConsoleView`, and `PersistenceService` (which could be interfaces in a more complex setup).
    *   `Peer` depends on `ConsoleView` and `PersistenceService`, which are injected via the constructor, allowing different implementations (though only one is used here).
    *   Concrete commands depend on abstractions like `Peer`, `ConsoleView`, `PersistenceService`.

### Design Patterns

*   **Singleton Pattern:** Used in `PeerController` to ensure that only one instance of the main controller exists throughout the application's lifecycle. This is crucial for managing the central state (like the list of connected peers and the main `Peer` instance). Implemented using a private constructor, a static `volatile` instance variable, and a static `getInstance()` method with double-checked locking.
*   **Command Pattern:** User actions are encapsulated as objects (`ConnectCommand`, `DownloadFileCommand`, etc.), all implementing the `Command` interface with an `execute()` method. `PeerController` holds a map of menu options to `Command` objects. This decouples the invoker (`PeerController`) from the specific actions being performed, making it easy to add new actions (OCP) and manage the execution flow.
*   **Facade Pattern:** The `Peer` class acts as a Facade, providing a simplified, higher-level interface (`connectToPeer`, `listAvailableFiles`, `downloadFile`) to the more complex underlying subsystems and operations involved in P2P communication (managing the `ServerSocket`, handling `Socket` connections, managing threads for `PeerHandler`, coordinating `PeerConnection` objects, implementing the simple LIST/GET protocol).
*   **Repository Pattern (Conceptual):** The `PersistenceService` class acts as a Repository. It mediates between the application's domain logic (requiring access to peers or history) and the data mapping layer (JDBC/SQLite). It provides a collection-like interface (`loadPeers`, `getDownloadHistory`, `savePeer`, `recordDownload`) for accessing domain data, abstracting the underlying SQLite database details.
